*NOTE* Estrangement is about specilization and
compartmentalization.

  - communities
  - families    -- replaced by state and market
  - small numbers
  - nutritious variety of diet

  - circadian cycles, light and dark
  - day and night, seasons

  - children are separated from adults most of the time and
    detained in schools so that parents are freed to work in
    factories and offices

  - teens living in separate sub-cultures cut off from
    chilren and adults

  - adults are cut off from their children and their parents
    live by the same regimented schedule every day, and are
    reduced to doing a very narrow range of activities and
    have little free time to be with family, friends, study
    or simple rest and recharge

  - the elderly are left alone without purpose and often
    even without human contact.

  - cut off from the natural environment
  - cut off from the sky and stars
  - our buildings are not fit to live in

  - our towns and cities have been designed to make
    communities impossible

  - many of us no longer know how to process natural plants
    and animals for consumption -- increasingly, we don't
    even know how to cook
