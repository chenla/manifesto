*  The Yellow Brick Road: a manifesto for an augmented distributed civilization

The manifesto should map out the augmented distributed
civilization we propose to build that will act like a 
soap bubble overlaying the existing civilization.

* Constants

Constants are bedrock variables that define things that can
not be changed like the speed of light or dunbar's number.
They supercede what we want or what we would like and
provide empirical design limits.  No theses can =violate= or
contradict a =constant=.

 - [[./constant--shared_intentionality.org][Shared Intentionality]]


* Theses

Scopic Theses are declarations that provide a foundation for
a =civil ruleset= for people to live and cooperate with each
other.  Our theses is a social fiction that defines how we
/want/ to live and behave with each other.

 - [[./theses-notes.org][Theses Notes]]

* Patterns

Patterns are repeating themes in nature, design and human
behavior that when combined with other patterns strengthen
each other and create things that are larger than the sum of
their parts.


* Roadmap

A Roadmap for Mankind over the next 50 years to move from
being a centralized global civilization, with crtical
knowledge, infrastructure and wealth pooled in a handful of
people, places, and organizations, to a distributed
multiplanetary civilization reflecting the needs of a
rapidly shrinking population on earth and an increasingly
hostile climate.
