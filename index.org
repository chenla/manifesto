manifesto, declaring opinions, motivations, intentions --
but in the case...

I was never completely comfortable with bitcoin -- and it
just struck me last night why.  

We've come to assume that our civilization is normal, when
it is actually completely broken.  So when things break we
don't go back and say, hey the system is broken, so let's
fix it.  No, we treat the broken system as normal and try to
make it work.  But you can't.  It's broken.

it all seems to come down to compartmentalization -- Man
really doesn't scale, and it's clear that we can not treat
Man as individuals in every context.
