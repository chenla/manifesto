 - The Window -- 50 years plus or minus 20

 - the only thing that has saved us after we have fouled our
   own beds and made them uninhabitable is that we move on
   to the next place and reduce pressure on our old homes to
   let them heal, if we haven't destroyed it beyond its
   ability to heal.  we expand or we die.

 - but we are now faced with the fact that we have nearly
   exhausted all of the low hanging fruit -- energy and
   natural resources and our population has exceeded the
   carrying capacity of the biosphere.

 - we need to expand into the solar system -- where there is
   no shortage of natural resources and energy

    - all energy is nuclear, be it fossil fuels, wind or
      solar or our own limmited ability to split or fuse the
      atom

    - it is likely that within a lifetime or two at most,
      the majority of energy that mankind uses will be for
      computation -- even today, Google alone represents 1-2
      percent of energy use in the united states.  solar and
      renewables can likely satisfy all of our other energy
      requirements -- but not computation
