* Introduction

#+begin_quote
For those who find it tough to juggle more than a couple
things at once, don't despair. The brain is set up to manage
two tasks, but not more, a new study suggests.

That's because, when faced with two tasks, a part of the
brain known as the medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) divides so
that half of the region focuses on one task and the other
half on the other task. This division of labor allows a
person to keep track of two tasks pretty readily, but if you
throw in a third, things get a bit muddled.

"What really the results show is that we can readily divide
tasking. We can cook, and at the same time talk on the
phone, and switch back and forth between these two
activities," said study researcher Etienne Koechlin of the
Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, France. "However,
we cannot multitask with more than two tasks."

And of course there is a price to be paid for context switching...
